    <h1>Guitar History</h1>
    <p>
      The Spanish guitar or creole guitar, as it is known in some places in
      Latin America, is a musical instrument of the chordophone family with a
      very old origin but which begins to have a very remarkable importance
      after the Renaissance. It was at this time that the contrapuntal
      repertoire of plucked string instruments was developed: of the vihuela in
      Spain and America and of the lute in the rest of Europe, which gave rise
      to the classical guitar.
